# RL_project1

## Environment
  * Python 2.7.14
  * Test case was generated and saved as a file so that it re-produces the result. 
  * The same test case was used for all experimentation.
  * Libraries used: time, random, numpy, pandas and mtplotlib.pyplot
  * time was used to calculate the process time for each experimentation and not for actual experimentation.

## How To Run
  * *python project1.py* to run
  * Make sure test data "test_seq5" is in the same directory with the python script, "project1.py"
  * Even though all the 3 figures can be run at once, the process doesn't show any response and looks buggy so I would recommend to run one by one like commenting in and out of the line "start_figure3", "start_figure4" and "start_figure5"
  * I've commented out the lines related to create the test cases. Only reading the test case is in use to reproduce all my graphs in the report.
